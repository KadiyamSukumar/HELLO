DATA SCIENCE SMS CLASSIFIER TASK 1 :

Creating a robust SMS classifier involves several steps in the data science pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. Here's a detailed walkthrough of each step:

1. Data Collection:
Start by gathering a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or non-spam (ham). You can find such datasets from various sources like the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle. Ensure that the dataset is balanced and representative of the problem.
2. Data Preprocessing:
Clean the data by removing any irrelevant characters, punctuation, and special symbols.
Convert the text to lowercase to maintain consistency.
Tokenize the text into individual words or tokens.
Remove stopwords (commonly occurring words like "and", "the", "is") as they carry little semantic meaning.
Perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root form.
3. Feature Extraction:
Use techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features.
Alternatively, you can use word embeddings such as Word2Vec or GloVe to represent words in a dense vector space.
4. Model Selection:
Choose a suitable classification algorithm based on the dataset size, complexity, and performance requirements.
Commonly used algorithms for text classification include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers.
5. Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Train the chosen model on the training data.
6. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Analyze the model's performance and tune hyperparameters if necessary to improve results.
7. Deployment:
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it into production.
Set up an interface (web app, API) for users to interact with the classifier.
Implement monitoring and feedback loops to continuously improve the model's performance over time.

DATA SCIENCE USING TECHNIQUES OF PYTHON:

To classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham) using data science techniques in Python, you can follow these steps:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the SMS data.
Feature Extraction: Extract features from the text data.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model on the extracted features.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance.
Deployment: Deploy the model for classifying new SMS messages.
Here's how you can implement each step:

1. Data Preprocessing:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import re
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

# Load the SMS data
data = pd.read_csv('sms_data.csv')

# Clean and preprocess the text data
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
ps = PorterStemmer()

def preprocess_text(text):
    text = re.sub(r'\W', ' ', text)  # Remove non-word characters
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)  # Remove extra whitespaces
    text = text.lower()               # Convert to lowercase
    words = word_tokenize(text)       # Tokenize text into words
    words = [ps.stem(word) for word in words if word not in stop_words]  # Stemming
    return ' '.join(words)

data['clean_text'] = data['text'].apply(preprocess_text)
2. Feature Extraction:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Initialize TF-IDF Vectorizer
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the cleaned text data
X = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(data['clean_text'])
y = data['label']
3. Model Training:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Naive Bayes classifier
nb_classifier = MultinomialNB()
nb_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
4. Model Evaluation:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Predictions
y_pred = nb_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Model evaluation
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
5. Deployment:
Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it using various methods such as Flask API, Django, or deploying as a web service on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.

Ensure to replace 'sms_data.csv' with the path to your SMS dataset file. This example uses the Naive Bayes classifier, but you can experiment with other classifiers like SVM, Random Forest, or deep learning models for potentially better performance.


import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Sample SMS data (you should replace this with your own dataset)
sms_data = {
    'message': ["Free entry in 2 a wkly comp to win FA Cup final tkts 21st May 2005.", 
                "Hey, what's up? Are we still meeting tomorrow?", 
                "URGENT! You have won a 1 week FREE membership in our Â£100,000 Prize Jackpot!"],
    'label': ['spam', 'ham', 'spam']
}

# Convert data to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(sms_data)

# Preprocessing: Convert labels to numerical values (0 for ham, 1 for spam)
df['label'] = df['label'].map({'ham': 0, 'spam': 1})

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['message'], df['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# TF-IDF Vectorization
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
tfidf_train = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
tfidf_test = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Train Naive Bayes classifier
nb_classifier = MultinomialNB()
nb_classifier.fit(tfidf_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = nb_classifier.predict(tfidf_test)

# Model evaluation
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
